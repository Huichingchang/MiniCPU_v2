## üìã Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

| Opcode (instr[7:4]) | Instruction | Description               |
|---------------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| `0001`              | LOAD A      | Load `instr[3:0]` into Register A |
| `0010`              | LOAD B      | Load `instr[3:0]` into Register B |
| `0100`              | ADD         | ALU performs `A + B`      |
| `0101`              | SUB         | ALU performs `A - B`      |
| `0110`              | STORE       | Store ALU result to `data_result` |

## üß© Module Overview

- `cpu_core.v`: Top-level CPU integration module  
- `instr_mem.v`: Instruction ROM (hard-coded example)  
- `reg_file.v`: Register file with Register A and B  
- `alu.v`: Arithmetic Logic Unit (supports ADD & SUB)  
- `control_unit.v`: Finite State Machine (FSM) control logic  
- `cpu_core_tb.v`: Testbench for simulation

## üñºÔ∏è Waveform Result

The following waveform illustrates execution of the 4 instructions:  
**LOAD A ‚Üí LOAD B ‚Üí ADD ‚Üí STORE**

- PC increments sequentially  
- `reg_a` and `reg_b` are loaded correctly  
- ALU outputs result = 3  
- Result is latched into `data_result`

## üìå Potential Enhancements

- Add more ALU operations (AND, OR, XOR, etc.)
- Implement Jump / Branch instructions
- Integrate memory access (RAM, I/O)
- Convert ROM to writable memory
- Connect to UART for serial output display
